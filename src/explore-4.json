      "description": "Thoreau preferred to observe nature with the naked eye, not through a lens. It was after much internal debate that he decided to spend $8 .00 < br > --a rare splurge-- < br > on this spyglass in the spring of 1854. He was delighted with his enhanced ability to study bird behaviors and other natural phenomena. ",
